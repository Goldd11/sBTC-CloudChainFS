#  Decentralized Cloud Storage on Stacks Blockchain

This smart contract implements a decentralized cloud storage system where users can **upload**, **update**, **delete**, **transfer ownership**, and **manage access permissions** for their files ‚Äî all transparently and immutably on the **Stacks blockchain**.

## üìú Contract Constants

```clojure
(define-constant contract-owner tx-sender)
(define-constant err-owner-only (err u100))
(define-constant err-not-found (err u101))
(define-constant err-already-exists (err u102))

(define-constant err-invalid-size (err u104))
(define-constant err-unauthorized (err u105))
(define-constant err-invalid-recipient (err u106))
```

## üß± Data Structures

### üîê `files` (Map)

Stores metadata for each uploaded file:

* `file-id: uint` ‚Äì Unique identifier
* `owner: principal` ‚Äì File owner
* `name: (string-ascii 64)` ‚Äì File name
* `size: uint` ‚Äì File size (bytes)
* `created-at: uint` ‚Äì Block height when file was added

### üßæ `file-permissions` (Map)

Stores access control info for file sharing:

* Key: `{ file-id, user }`
* Value: `{ permission: bool }`

### üìä `total-files` (Data var)

A counter that keeps track of how many files have been uploaded.

---

## üîì Public Functions

### `upload-file (name, size)`

Uploads a new file to the system.

* ‚úÖ Name must be between 1 and 64 characters
* ‚úÖ Size must be > 0 and ‚â§ 1 GB (`1,000,000,000` bytes)

```clojure
(upload-file "photo.jpg" u2048)
;; Returns: (ok u1)
```

---

### `update-file (file-id, new-name, new-size)`

Updates metadata of a file. Only the file owner can call this.

```clojure
(update-file u1 "photo_v2.jpg" u4096)
;; Returns: (ok true)
```

---

### `delete-file (file-id)`

Deletes a file. Only the file owner can call this.

```clojure
(delete-file u1)
;; Returns: (ok true)
```

---

### `transfer-file-ownership (file-id, new-owner)`

Transfers ownership to another principal.

```clojure
(transfer-file-ownership u1 'SP...XYZ)
;; Returns: (ok true)
```

---

### `grant-permission (file-id, permission, recipient)`

Grants or revokes permission for another user to access a file.

* Can‚Äôt grant permission to yourself
* Only file owner can perform this

```clojure
(grant-permission u1 true 'SP...ABC)
;; Returns: (ok true)
```

---

### `revoke-permission (file-id, user)`

Revokes access permission from a specific user.

```clojure
(revoke-permission u1 'SP...ABC)
;; Returns: (ok true)
```

---

## üîç Read-Only Functions

### `get-total-files`

Returns the total number of files uploaded.

```clojure
(get-total-files)
;; Returns: (ok u5)
```

---

### `get-file-info (file-id)`

Retrieves metadata for a given file.

```clojure
(get-file-info u1)
;; Returns: (ok { owner: 'SP...', name: "photo.jpg", size: u2048, created-at: u12345 })
```

---

## üîí Internal Utility Functions (Private)

* `file-exists` ‚Äì Checks if a file exists
* `get-owner-file` ‚Äì Validates ownership
* `get-file-size-by-owner` ‚Äì Retrieves a file's size

## üö´ Error Handling

| Error Code | Meaning                          |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| `err u100` | Owner-only function restriction  |
| `err u101` | File not found                   |
| `err u102` | File already exists              |
| `err u103` | Invalid file name                |
| `err u104` | Invalid file size                |
| `err u105` | Unauthorized access              |
| `err u106` | Invalid recipient for permission |

---

## üìå Deployment Notes

* This contract is written in **Clarity**, the smart contract language for the **Stacks blockchain**.
* Be sure to deploy it using a compatible Clarity tool like [Clarinet](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet) or the Stacks CLI.
